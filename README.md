## Where do I commit?

- Main - used for complete version of the game, everything is working fine, no errors, basically release-ready version

- Development - used for working build of the game, no errors there. Just unfinished features and reinvented bicycles.

- XCodeRelese - used for XCode project of the game build. **DO NOT EVEN TOUCH THIS BRANCH IF YOU AT LEAST DON'T OWN A MACBOOK**

- Debug - Hell, pain and suffering!
